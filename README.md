Code does not run to a weird errors. (appears in the file) Unsure how well everything would run if the imports would fuction, but everything is implemented. Doubt graphics work.

In terms of how my game is supposed to function, it is very barebones currently since I honestly didn't read the second part until an hour and a half ago since I wrongfully assumed the python file named hw1 would have all the content. I did want it to be a linear tower where you could not go back though- If I had time, I would like to make this game as something with lots of items you need from previous rooms and a set inventory size. Unlike most CYOA games, where you try to promote lots of freedom of choices, this one would be more of a puzzle, where with every failure you gain more information, and whenever you reach a new room, you need to guess and hope that you take the right items based on clues. Theres a lot more I need to work out, but I think this is a fun idea.

The current game is very much a sorta joke, but its intended to be that way- The only way to lose is to intentionally destroy your key.
